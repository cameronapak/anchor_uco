  Many ask the question “Why is there so much division in the Church?” Our
  generation is developing a desire for unity and for one night dozens of faith
  based students communities will be throwing aside our individual
  representations for the sake of the common unity we have through Jesus.
  Worship and experience a united front led by students and hosted by students
  for the glory and honor of Jesus Christ.
