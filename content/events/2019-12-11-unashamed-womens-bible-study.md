title: Unashamed Women's Bible Study
when: 'February-March '
time: To Be Determined
where: 'Jessica''s House '
what: ' In this 5 week study Christine Caine shows that if we want to be free of shame and change our future, we have to believe God is bigger than our mistakes, our inadequacies and our limitations. We have to lay hold of the power of Jesus today and step into the future he has planned for us. We have to believe we can live unashamed. '
